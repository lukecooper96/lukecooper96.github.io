		Personal Reflection:
		</h3>
	<body>
		We are making a game that resembles pong. The goal of this game is to move a block back and forth along a linear path to block a ball from leaving the field of play. Think brick breaker except without bricks. We will have to give the ball hit detection and bounce abilities as well as keep the wall moving in a linear path. Every time the wall we control at the bottom blocks the ball your score will increase by one. The goal of the game is to last as long as possible with increasing speed as time goes on making the game harder and harder.
