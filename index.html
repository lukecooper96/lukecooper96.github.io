	<h2>Description</h2>
		Our group decided to make a calculator that will ask what the user wants to do, then take its inputs and comes out with a solution.  The calculator will be able to 	multiply, divide, add, subtract as well as other basic mathematical formulas.  These other formulas could include functions that use the Pythagorean Theorem or Newton’s Laws. We will also attempt to take in more than two inputs from the user instead of just two. The calculator will have multiple steps and ask very specifically what the user wants to do. The calculator will be very intuitive with no confusing steps.  



	<h2>Luke’s Reflection</h2>

		We wanted to created a simple calculator, and in that aspect I believe that our group met our goal. We were actually able to complete the four major functions fairly quickly, so the add on are what took the most time. We really wanted to make a calculator with a GUI that included all our equations, but we couldn’t find a way to do it without using someone elses code, and we didn’t even know how their code worked. If we were to do this project again then we would probably research calculator GUI’s more and incorporate that.
